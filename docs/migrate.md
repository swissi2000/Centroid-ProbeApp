# ProbeApp Migrate to a new Version of CNC12

## Migration Steps

* Follow Centroids Instructions on how to Upgrade CNC12 to the new version
* After the new Version of CNC12 is installed and the Report file has been restored, simply copy over the **C:\cncm\probing** folder from the backup of your old CNC12 version to the new one.
* Verify that the mfunc58.mac (and other files like mfunc6.mac if you customized them for the ProbeApp) have been migrated over properly by the CNC12 Report restore process.
* Launch ProbeApp and it should start up like it did in the old version of CNC12
