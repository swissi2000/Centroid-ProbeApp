To uninstall the older version of ProbeApp, launch Windows *Add or remove programs*

Click the *ProbeApp-Setup* icon and select *Uninstall*.

Note that the file *ProbeApp.cfg* that holds the history and configuration parameters of the ProbeApp will not be removed, so all your configuration settings will move over to the new version.

After the uninstall has been completed, follow the [ProbeApp Installation Instructions](install.md) to install the new version.
